## API Overview

The CareerOS API is organized into multiple API versions and feature modules:

### Core API Versions

- **Public API V1** (`/public/v1/*`) - Public endpoints for discovery and authentication (no auth required)
- **API V1** (`/api/v1/*`) - Main authenticated API with 100+ endpoints for students and advisors
- **API V2** (`/api/v2/*`) - Enhanced career advisor tools with advanced analytics
- **Webhook API** (`/webhook/*`) - Real-time notifications from external services

### Feature Modules

**Stable Modules:**
- **Resume OS** - AI-powered resume building, scoring, and review workflow
- **EventOS** - Career event discovery, registration, and calendar integration
- **AlumniOS** - Alumni networking and mentorship connections

## Working with this repo

### Install

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install` in the repo root.

### Usage

#### `npm start`
Starts the reference docs preview server.

#### `npm run build`
Bundles the definition to the dist folder.

#### `npm run lint`
Runs lint on the definition.

## Configuration

The `.redocly.yaml` controls settings for various
tools including the lint tool and the reference
docs engine.  Open it to find examples and
[read the docs](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/configuration/)
for more information.


### Schemas

#### Adding Schemas

1. Navigate to the `openapi/components/schemas` folder.
2. Add a file named as you wish to name the schema.
3. Define the schema.
4. Refer to the schema using the `$ref` (see example below).

##### Example Schema
This is a very simple schema example:
```yaml
type: string
description: The resource ID. Defaults to UUID v4
maxLength: 50
example: 4f6cf35x-2c4y-483z-a0a9-158621f77a21
```
This is a more complex schema example:
```yaml
type: object
properties:
  id:
    description: The customer identifier string
    readOnly: true
    allOf:
      - $ref: ./ResourceId.yaml
  websiteId:
    description: The website's ID
    allOf:
      - $ref: ./ResourceId.yaml
  paymentToken:
    type: string
    writeOnly: true
    description: |
      A write-only payment token; if supplied, it will be converted into a
      payment instrument and be set as the `defaultPaymentInstrument`. The
      value of this property will override the `defaultPaymentInstrument`
      in the case that both are supplied. The token may only be used once
      before it is expired.
  defaultPaymentInstrument:
    $ref: ./PaymentInstrument.yaml
  createdTime:
    description: The customer created time
    allOf:
      - $ref: ./ServerTimestamp.yaml
  updatedTime:
    description: The customer updated time
    allOf:
      - $ref: ./ServerTimestamp.yaml
  tags:
    description: A list of customer's tags
    readOnly: true
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./Tags/Tag.yaml
  revision:
    description: >
      The number of times the customer data has been modified.

      The revision is useful when analyzing webhook data to determine if the
      change takes precedence over the current representation.
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
  _links:
    type: array
    description: The links related to resource
    readOnly: true
    minItems: 3
    items:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: ./Links/SelfLink.yaml
        - $ref: ./Links/NotesLink.yaml
        - $ref: ./Links/DefaultPaymentInstrumentLink.yaml
        - $ref: ./Links/LeadSourceLink.yaml
        - $ref: ./Links/WebsiteLink.yaml
  _embedded:
    type: array
    description: >-
      Any embedded objects available that are requested by the `expand`
      querystring parameter.
    readOnly: true
    minItems: 1
    items:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: ./Embeds/LeadSourceEmbed.yaml

```

If you have an JSON example, you can convert it to JSON schema using Redocly's [JSON to JSON schema tool](https://redocly.com/tools/json-to-json-schema/).

##### Using the `$ref`

Notice in the complex example above the schema definition itself has `$ref` links to other schemas defined.

Here is a small excerpt with an example:

```yaml
defaultPaymentInstrument:
  $ref: ./PaymentInstrument.yaml
```

The value of the `$ref` is the path to the other schema definition.

You may use `$ref`s to compose schema from other existing schema to avoid duplication.

You will use `$ref`s to reference schema from your path definitions.

#### Editing Schemas

1. Navigate to the `openapi/components/schemas` folder.
2. Open the file you wish to edit.
3. Edit.

### Paths

#### Adding a Path

1. Navigate to the `openapi/paths` folder.
2. Add a new YAML file named like your URL endpoint except replacing `/` with `_` (or whichever character you prefer) and putting path parameters into curly braces like `{example}`.
3. Add the path and a ref to it inside of your `openapi.yaml` file inside of the `openapi` folder.

Example addition to the `openapi.yaml` file:
```yaml
'/customers/{id}':
  $ref: './paths/customers_{id}.yaml'
```

Here is an example of a YAML file named `customers_{id}.yaml` in the `paths` folder:

```yaml
get:
  tags:
    - Customers
  summary: Retrieve a list of customers
  operationId: GetCustomerCollection
  description: |
    You can have a markdown description here.
  parameters:
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionLimit.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionOffset.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionFilter.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionQuery.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionExpand.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionFields.yaml
  responses:
    '200':
      description: A list of Customers was retrieved successfully
      headers:
        Rate-Limit-Limit:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Rate-Limit-Limit.yaml
        Rate-Limit-Remaining:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Rate-Limit-Remaining.yaml
        Rate-Limit-Reset:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Rate-Limit-Reset.yaml
        Pagination-Total:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Pagination-Total.yaml
        Pagination-Limit:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Pagination-Limit.yaml
        Pagination-Offset:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Pagination-Offset.yaml
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: ../components/schemas/Customer.yaml
        text/csv:
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: ../components/schemas/Customer.yaml
    '401':
      $ref: ../components/responses/AccessForbidden.yaml
  x-code-samples:
    - lang: PHP
      source:
        $ref: ../code_samples/PHP/customers/get.php
post:
  tags:
    - Customers
  summary: Create a customer (without an ID)
  operationId: PostCustomer
  description: Another markdown description here.
  requestBody:
    $ref: ../components/requestBodies/Customer.yaml
  responses:
    '201':
      $ref: ../components/responses/Customer.yaml
    '401':
      $ref: ../components/responses/AccessForbidden.yaml
    '409':
      $ref: ../components/responses/Conflict.yaml
    '422':
      $ref: ../components/responses/InvalidDataError.yaml
  x-code-samples:
    - lang: PHP
      source:
        $ref: ../code_samples/PHP/customers/post.php
```

You'll see extensive usage of `$ref`s in this example to different types of components including schemas.

You'll also notice `$ref`s to code samples.

### Code samples

Automated code sample generations is enabled in the Redocly configuration file. Add manual code samples by the following process:

1. Navigate to the `openapi/code_samples` folder.
2. Navigate to the `<language>` (e.g. PHP) sub-folder.
3. Navigate to the `path` folder, and add ref to the code sample.

You can add languages by adding new folders at the appropriate path level.

More details inside the `code_samples` folder README.
